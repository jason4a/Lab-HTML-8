      <p>Telemetry Technician:  I monitor EKG readings of patients that require cardiac monitoring. Additionally I record and then notify the medical staff of any potential concerns. Throughout the shift, I am measuring the readings to determine if any portion of the EKG is out of normal ranges. The most important aspect of this job is to initiate the Rapid Response Team if a patient encounters a life-threatening heart rhythm. So far during my tenure in this position, I have had to sound the emergency alarm several times.   </p>
